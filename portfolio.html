          <h3>Junior Cloud Developer</h3>
          <h4>Righteous AI Inc.</h4>
          <h4>March 2022 - Present</h4>
          <p>• Developed a self-service DevOps application for automated actuarial code deployment using C# and .NET Core, resulting in a reduction of deployment time by 50% and eliminating manual errors in the process.</p>
          <p>• Designed and developed Python-based ETL pipelines for data processing and analysis for the Actuarial models, which used the new concept of configuration-as-code to allow for pipeline definition using YAML language. The ETL pipelines were flexible and reusable for handling Python pandas data and processing. It resulted in a significant increase in data processing efficiency and reduction in data errors.</p>
          <p>• Implemented pytest framework for automated testing, resulting in a 40% reduction in manual testing efforts and increasing code coverage above 80%. This improved software quality, reduced the number of production defects, and enhanced overall code stability.</p>
          <p>• Developed and maintained Docker images and containers in production environments to ensure scalability, availability, and performance. Developed Docker-based workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, leading to a great improvement in scalability and a reduction in infrastructure costs.</p>
          <p>• Created and deployed Kubernetes clusters and managed Kubernetes pods and services in production environments to ensure scalability, availability, and performance. Developed Kubernetes-based workflows for CI/CD pipelines, which resulted in a increase in application availability and a 75% reduction in deployment time.</p>
          <p>• Developed custom VS Code extensions for productivity and collaboration tools and maintained web applications using Node.js. Developed and maintained web applications using modern front-end frameworks such as React and Vanilla JS. Developed and maintained scripts for website functionality and automation, leading to an increase in developer productivity and great improvements in collaboration efficiency.</p>
          <p>• Developed and optimized databases for business and enterprise clients, designed and implemented complex database schemas and queries, and optimized database performance for large-scale data processing and analysis, resulting in an improvement in query performance and more than 90% reduction in database unused space.</p>
          <p>• Developed and maintained cloud-based applications and services using Microsoft Azure services, integrated Azure services such as Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure AD into cloud-based applications for a financial services client and developed and maintained CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps for a software development team, resulting in a 50% reduction in operational costs and an increase in system reliability.</p>
          <p>• Managed code repositories for collaborative software development for a team, implemented code review processes using Git pull requests, and developed and maintained Git workflows for CI/CD pipelines and software releases for a variety of projects. Managed code repositories for website hosting through GitHub pages service, which resulted in a significant reduction in software defects and a 20% improvement in overall code quality.</p>
