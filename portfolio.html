          <h3>Junior Cloud Developer</h3>
          <h4>Righteous AI Inc.</h4>
          <h4>March 2022 - Present</h4>
          <p>• Developed a self-service DevOps application for automated actuarial code deployment using C# and .NET
            Core, resulting in a reduction of deployment time by 50% and eliminating manual errors in the process.</p>
          <p>• Designed and developed Python-based ETL pipelines for data processing and analysis for the Actuarial
            models, which used the new concept of configuration-as-code to allow for pipeline definition using YAML
            language. The ETL pipelines were flexible and reusable for handling Python pandas data and processing. It
            resulted in a significant increase in data processing efficiency and reduction in data errors.</p>
          <p>• Implemented pytest framework for automated testing, resulting in a 40% reduction in manual testing
            efforts and increasing code coverage above 80%. This improved software quality, reduced the number of
            production defects, and enhanced overall code stability.</p>
          <p>• Developed and maintained Docker images and containers in production environments to ensure scalability,
            availability, and performance. Developed Docker-based workflows for continuous integration and continuous
            deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, leading to a great improvement in scalability and a reduction in
            infrastructure costs.</p>
          <p>• Created and deployed Kubernetes clusters and managed Kubernetes pods and services in production
            environments to ensure scalability, availability, and performance. Developed Kubernetes-based workflows for
            CI/CD pipelines, which resulted in a increase in application availability and a 75% reduction in deployment
            time.</p>
          <p>• Developed custom VS Code extensions for productivity and collaboration tools and maintained web
            applications using Node.js. Developed and maintained web applications using modern front-end frameworks such
            as React and Vanilla JS. Developed and maintained scripts for website functionality and automation, leading
            to an increase in developer productivity and great improvements in collaboration efficiency.</p>
          <p>• Developed and optimized databases for business and enterprise clients, designed and implemented complex
            database schemas and queries, and optimized database performance for large-scale data processing and
            analysis, resulting in an improvement in query performance and more than 90% reduction in database unused
            space.</p>
          <p>• Developed and maintained cloud-based applications and services using Microsoft Azure services, integrated
            Azure services such as Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure AD into cloud-based applications for a
            financial services client and developed and maintained CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps for a software
            development team, resulting in a 50% reduction in operational costs and an increase in system reliability.
          </p>
          <p>• Managed code repositories for collaborative software development for a team, implemented code review
            processes using Git pull requests, and developed and maintained Git workflows for CI/CD pipelines and
            software releases for a variety of projects. Managed code repositories for website hosting through GitHub
            pages service, which resulted in a significant reduction in software defects and a 20% improvement in
            overall code quality.</p>
